# TODO

High-level pending tasks and cleanup items for LiveHD.

## Test Organization

Tests are scattered across the codebase. Some subsystems place tests in
dedicated `tests/` directories (core, lgraph, lnast, inou/pyrope) while others
have test files alongside source code (upass, pass/label, pass/mockturtle,
main, inou/lefdef, inou/liveparse).

Rules to enforce:

- All main C++ tests must live in a `tests/` subdirectory under each component.

- A file should only use the `_test.cpp` suffix (e.g., `foo_test.cpp`) when
  there is a corresponding `foo.cpp` in the parent directory. Otherwise it is
  just a standalone test and should not carry the `_test` suffix.

- When the `_test` convention is used, it must be a suffix, never a prefix
  (`foo_test.cpp`, not `test_foo.cpp`).

- Create a separate `contracts/` directory (per component or top-level) for
  higher-level integration and API tests. Contracts test only public/high-level
  APIs and overall integration. Agents should not edit contract tests directly;
  they are maintained by hand to guarantee stable interface behavior.

- Treat compile-driver scripts as contracts, not ordinary tests. Move
  `yosys_compile.sh`, `slang_compile.sh`, and the other `*_compile.sh` scripts
  out of `tests/` directories and place them under a consistent `contracts/`
  structure.

## Source location (LOC) propagation strategy

Decide how LOC anchors (`file:line:col`, module, pipeline-stage) flow through
LNAST and LGraph so that `sigref("alu.flag_z")`, hot-probe injection
(`docs/contracts/simulation.md`), waveform-to-source mapping, and the
invariant-detector code generator can all map an internal signal back to
agent-editable Pyrope without best-effort heuristics.

### Hard commitments (not in scope for this decision)

- Every `Partition` (`comb` / `pipe[N]` / `mod`) keeps its declaration LOC.
- Every port (input/output of a partition) keeps its declaration LOC.
- Every register and memory declaration keeps its LOC.

These ride on the partition descriptor / port struct and are mandatory
through every pass.

### Open: how to handle everything else (internal wires, SSA temps, synthesized cells)

The naive "anchor on every value" approach is expensive and brittle in practice.
The favored direction is a **source-map indirection**: build one canonical
source map from the original Pyrope, and let internal names (SSA / temp /
synthesized) point at one or more locations in that map (so an alias
`a = b` can legitimately reference both `a`'s and `b`'s sites).

#### Issues to resolve

- Alias chains (`a = b; c = a`): does `c` map to `{a, b}`, `{a, b, c}`, or
  follow transitive closure? Closure could explode on deeply aliased SSA.
- Synthesized cells with no surface name (e.g., a `Mux` born from an
  `if/elif` lowering, a `Sum` materialized during slice/concat lowering):
  which source location is the "right" one — the condition, the join, the
  containing statement, or the partition root as a fallback?
- Optimization passes that drop a name entirely (constprop folding,
  cell-removal): the indirection handle disappears; what does `sigref` on
  that name return after optimization?
- Round-trip through external Verilog + LEC must not lose the source map.
  Emit `// src: file:line:col` comments at egress? A sidecar `.srcmap`
  file? Both?
- Pass discipline: with per-cell LOC, every pass must remember to set
  anchors and CI catches misses. With a source map, pass authors mostly
  don't think about LOC, but a pass that *renames* an SSA value must
  update its indirection — quiet failure mode if forgotten.

#### Pros of source-map indirection

- One canonical store; cells carry a small index, not 8+ bytes of anchor.
- Multiple-location attribution is natural (alias case).
- Source-derived SSA names (`foo_l42_b` per `lnast_spec.md §13`) already
  encode source by construction — the source map is a formal version of
  that scheme.
- Verilog egress emits source-map references rather than duplicating LOC
  per wire.
- Pass surface is smaller; LOC-propagation logic is centralized.

#### Cons of source-map indirection

- Indirection adds a lookup at every debug query (`sigref`, waveform
  click-through, LEC failure attribution). Hot-probe injection needs fast
  resolution.
- Synthesized cells still need *some* attribution rule — falling back to
  the partition root is honest but coarse.
- Tools outside LiveHD (waveform viewers, external LEC) must learn the
  source-map format or rely on the Verilog-egress sidecar.
- Optimization that removes the last reference to a name loses the link;
  recovering it requires the optimization to log a "removed: <name> ->
  <loc>" entry into the source map, which is a discipline issue too.

#### Alternatives considered

1. **Per-cell LOC (full anchor on every value).** Matches the aspirational
   wording in `docs/contracts/simulation.md`. Maximum fidelity but every
   pass becomes responsible for LOC propagation; quiet failure mode when a
   pass forgets; memory cost on every cell.
2. **Boundary-only LOC.** Only the hard-commitment list above carries LOC.
   Internal signals return "no source mapping" when probed. Simplest
   contract; weakest UX for `sigref` on internal wires.
3. **Source-map indirection with multi-location names** *(favored)*. One
   source store; names index in; 1-to-many supported for aliases.
   Synthesized cells without a surface name fall back to the enclosing
   partition's anchor.
4. **LOC-on-LNAST-only, drop at LGraph.** Let LGraph be LOC-free; resolve
   through `LGraph cell -> LNAST node -> LOC` indirection at debug time.
   Requires LNAST to be retained alongside LGraph for the lifetime of a
   debug session; works only if the upass cache keeps LNAST around.
5. **Hybrid (the working assumption).** Hard commitments above + source
   map for the rest, with partition-root fallback. Verilog egress emits
   `// src:` comments derived from the source map.

#### To decide before implementation

- Source-map storage: in-memory only, on-disk sidecar, or both? On-disk is
  needed for the `runs/<test>/vN/` workflow in `simulation.md`.
- Lookup API surface: what does `sigref(name).source()` return when the
  name has 0, 1, or N locations?
- Lifetime: when an upass invalidates a tree's cache, does the
  corresponding source-map slab get invalidated atomically?
- Egress comment format: pick one (`// src: file:line:col`) and commit, so
  external LEC tooling can parse it reliably.

## simlib fixed-width int types

`simlib/uint.hpp` and `simlib/sint.hpp` (extracted from the `firrtl-sig`
upstream project, kept under `simlib/LICENSE.firrtl-sig`) are still used by
`core/tests/lconst_test.cpp` and the simlib examples. Once HLOP lands, these
types will be replaced/rewritten as part of the HLOP simulation runtime —
revisit the simlib int surface and the `firrtl-sig` attribution at that point.
