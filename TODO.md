# TODO

High-level pending tasks and cleanup items for LiveHD.

## Test Organization

Tests are scattered across the codebase. Some subsystems place tests in
dedicated `tests/` directories (core, lgraph, lnast, inou/pyrope) while others
have test files alongside source code (upass, pass/label, pass/mockturtle,
main, inou/lefdef, inou/liveparse).

Rules to enforce:

- All main C++ tests must live in a `tests/` subdirectory under each component.

- A file should only use the `_test.cpp` suffix (e.g., `foo_test.cpp`) when
  there is a corresponding `foo.cpp` in the parent directory. Otherwise it is
  just a standalone test and should not carry the `_test` suffix.

- When the `_test` convention is used, it must be a suffix, never a prefix
  (`foo_test.cpp`, not `test_foo.cpp`).

- Create a separate `contracts/` directory (per component or top-level) for
  higher-level integration and API tests. Contracts test only public/high-level
  APIs and overall integration. Agents should not edit contract tests directly;
  they are maintained by hand to guarantee stable interface behavior.

- Treat compile-driver scripts as contracts, not ordinary tests. Move
  `yosys_compile.sh`, `slang_compile.sh`, and the other `*_compile.sh` scripts
  out of `tests/` directories and place them under a consistent `contracts/`
  structure.
