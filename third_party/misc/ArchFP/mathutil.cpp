/*
  This will be some functions surrounding primes.

  Start with a class that holds a cache of the primes known to date.  This will lazy discover new primes as needed.
  We will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
  Keep the array of non-prime numbers (candidates) around.
  TODO:   Use logicals for now, but could use bits if size becomes an issue.
          Since we only ever need one of these objects, essentially everything will be static.

  Note: that to be able to prime factor all (signed or unsigned) 32 bit ints requires all primes up to
  sqrt(10^10) = 100,000.  Smallest prime factor is guaranteed to be in this list.  There may be prime factors
  greater than 100,000, but if we find no more prime factors less than 100,000, then the residue, whatever
  it is, must be prime.

  Note:   None of this is meant to be useful for LARGE number factoring such as useful in encryption algorithms.
