# Contribution and procedure ledger: D3, D4, and the Futamura projection

Opened while the CORE-ET/CVA6 queues drain. **Analysis and staging only** — no
shared Lean library was rebuilt, nothing was activated, and the live replay's
library context (R31.3) is unchanged. Working notes are under
`generated/port_staging/` (untracked); this file is the ledger.

## 0. Sources, pinned

| branch | path | ref | revision | date | files in scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| D3 | `livehd-d3-translation-validation` | `direction-3-translation-validation` | `78a3e0d8c10c3e1ce1627d8d54fa898ee4416d43` | 2026-10-04 | 300 |
| D4 | `livehd-d4-incremental` | `direction-4-incremental` | `f6ad1fe29f8f15aeda045115864fd81a34c33aef` | 2026-10-04 | 356 |
| FP | `livehd-futamura/livehd` | `projection` | `9bb41a09d6b57111ed2b3fd10102ec4ff174b6c6` | 2026-10-06 | 295 |

FP additionally pins a **semantic rev** it shares with livehd-new:
`90583be1349acbd25f740b176a406aa8bbe1251c`. Those shared copies are never
edited.

"FP" here is the **Futamura projection**, not floating point: none of the three
branches carries a floating-point semantic surface (`git ls-files` finds only
`docs/papers/LiveHD_IEEE_Micro20.pdf`).

Surveyed against master (`pass/lean`, `formal/lean`, `scripts`, `lhd/tests`):

| branch | new files | shared files that differ | master-only |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| D3 | 96 | 140 | 40 |
| D4 | 151 | 143 | 40 |
| FP | 105 | 141 | 40 |

The large `pass_lean.cpp` deltas (2,467–3,863 lines on every branch) are
**master's own refactor**, not branch content: master split that file into
`design_scan`, `lean_format`, `graph_access`, `emit_*`. The semantic surface to
port is the new Lean modules.

## 1. THE BLOCKING INCOMPATIBILITY: D3 and D4 are clockless

This is the first thing to establish, because getting it wrong silently
destroys the post-D2 work.

| branch | `DesignCert.lean` clock schema |
| --- | --- |
| master | `ClockDesc`, `DesignCert.clocks`, `FlopDesc.clock`, `FlopDesc.asyncReset`, `MemoryDesc.clock` |
| D3 | **none** — zero `ClockDesc`/`clocks` lines |
| D4 | **none** — zero; master adds **19** clock-related lines over it |
| FP | **present** — `ClockDesc` at line 108 (it shares the record with livehd-new at a pinned rev) |

**Therefore: D3's and D4's `DesignCert.lean` is never copied into master.**
Their contributions are carried *onto* master's clock-aware record. A port that
moved their file across would revert the multi-clock transport, and every
clock, reset and collision gate built on it, without a single test failing —
the modules would simply stop carrying clocks.

FP's copy is clock-aware **and pinned**: it is shared with livehd-new at a
fixed rev and is not edited here.

## 2. D4 — `CertIO` and the round-trip

**What it adds.** `Compiler/CertIO.lean` (a byte-level writer/parser:
`writeCert`, `renderCert`, `parseCert`, `readSource/readNode/readOutput/
readFlop/readMemory`) and `Compiler/CertIORoundTrip.lean`, whose top-level
obligation is

```lean
theorem parseCert_renderCert (D : DesignCert) : parseCert (renderCert D) = .ok D
```

Both are **`sorry`-free on D4**.

**The incompatibility, exactly.** `CertIO.lean` on D4 contains **zero**
occurrences of `clock`. It serializes sources, nodes, outputs, flops and
memories — and nothing else. So:

- it cannot round-trip master's `DesignCert`, which also carries `clocks`,
  `FlopDesc.clock`, `FlopDesc.asyncReset` and `MemoryDesc.clock`;
- `parseCert_renderCert` as stated on D4 is a theorem about a **different
  record**. Porting the file without extending it would produce a parser that
  silently drops the clock table while its round-trip theorem still typechecks
  over the clockless shape.

**Proof obligations to discharge on master** (none of which exist yet):

1. extend `renderCert`/`parseCert` with the clock table, `FlopDesc.clock`,
   `FlopDesc.asyncReset` and `MemoryDesc.clock`;
2. re-establish `parseCert_renderCert` over the **clock-aware** record;
3. a negative: a byte stream whose flop names a clock ordinal outside `clocks`
   must fail to parse rather than default to 0 — the same refusal
   `cert_shape_check.py` makes statically (R24.1).

## 3. D3 — the `Defs` proof split, and `Reify`

**The `Defs` split is the piece master most wants**, and it is about memory,
not layering. `CompileOpDefs.lean` says so:

> This module holds the EXECUTABLE definitions only, and imports no Mathlib.
> [...] The split exists for MEMORY, not for layering. `import Mathlib` cost
> every sweep probe **6,027,948 kB** of resident set that the probe never used
> — more than the entire design term for most modules. [...] Nothing here may
> acquire a `theorem`: a proof would pull Mathlib back in through the one
> import that is supposed to stay absent.

`CompileOp.lean` keeps exposing definitions *and* theorems, so every existing
importer is unaffected.

| module | lines | `sorry` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `CompileOpDefs.lean` | 100 | 0 |
| `CompileGraphDefs.lean` | 53 | 0 |
| `CompileDesignDefs.lean` | 104 | 0 |
| `Reify.lean` | 197 | 0 |
| `ReifyGen.lean` | 664 | 0 |
| `D3Harness.lean` | 390 | 0 |
| **`ReifyProof.lean`** | 1,327 | **4** |

`ReifyProof.lean`'s four `sorry`s are a **named incompleteness that travels
with the port** and must not be absorbed silently: nothing depending on them
may be reported as PROVEN.

**Why this matters here beyond D3.** The standing D3 sweep budget is ~20 GB
aggregate RSS, and the DINO measurements in this ledger run 8.4–13.3 GB per
job. A definition path that does not drag Mathlib in is the difference between
a probe that fits and one that does not. It is also the right carrier for the
direct sweep (R35), whose probes import `DirectTrace` for exactly this reason.

**Port order for D3:** the `Defs` split first (it is mechanical, `sorry`-free
and independently valuable), `Reify`/`ReifyGen` next, `ReifyProof` last and
with its four holes declared.

## 4. FP — the projection (this section was wrong and is corrected)

The first version of this ledger asked "what does `Projection` do that
`Compiler.Direct` does not, rather than porting both". That framing is wrong on
both counts, and the acceptance packet says so directly:

> Actual pinned implementation is **already clock-aware**.
> `specialize_correct_of` / `specializeDesign_correct` / `projectDesign_correct`
> quantify **edges, input, state** as 3 dynamic arguments; `DesignEncoding`
> round-trips flop `clock`/`asyncReset`, memory `clock`, `ClockDesc` names and
> `DesignCert.clocks`. Preserve these exact contributions, rather than imposing
> a clockless prototype story.

So FP is **not** a clockless prototype to be rationalised against `DirectSim`,
and it is not dropped because a simulator already exists. **38 `Projection`
modules** are to be carried, with their support docs, runner, transport and
overlay tools.

### 4.1 Four contracts that must survive the port

**Conditional support, not blanket support.** `projectDesign_correct` is a
fuel-free `Eval` ↔ `ResultRel (interpretDesign)` iff, **conditional on**
specialization success, `SupportedByProjection`, `RuntimeWF` and
`RuntimeSized`. A successful partial evaluation is not a statement that the
hardware is supported. **Memory support stays explicitly refused** until it is
actually proved.

**Host versus object language.** `SecondProjection` proves agreement with the
object-language `mixProgram` **only**. `mixProgram_implements_mixHost` is
documented as a larger **unproved** obligation. Gate0's object-vs-host tests
may **not** be promoted to a universal derived-compiler equality — and the
first and second projection interfaces stay separate.

**An admission-policy difference, not a semantics change.**
`ProjectedStep.runtimeOK` requires `D.clocks.size ≤ edgeVector.size`, while
master's `Direct.checkRuntime` requires the edge vector to match **exactly**
(R-series). That is two retained interfaces disagreeing about admission. It is
preserved and documented as such, not silently reconciled, unless the user
adopts a policy change.

**Axiom discipline.** `PrimaryAudit` carries **311 exact `#print axioms`
obligations**; the universal library proof policy allows standard axioms only,
with **no `native_decide` assumptions**. Prototype paths have their own
`ProtoAudit` obligations and their own status, and `.build-proj.sh` builds **33
targets, not all 38 modules** — a prototype marked blocked or research cannot
be counted as a correct runtime implementation by copying it.

### 4.2 A name collision to resolve

FP's `Compiler.CertIO` shares a module name with **D4's**, and deliberately
drops things D4 keeps. Both cannot occupy that name in one tree. Resolving it
must not lose D4's checked-compiler paths or FP's `asyncOK`/transport
constraints, and the clock-aware version must never silently load older data
with the metadata omitted.

## 5. Procedure

1. **Nothing is activated while a queue is live.** Shared-library changes wait
   for the live handles to become terminal, and their final source and library
   fingerprints are recorded first (R31.3 is the current one).
2. **Carry contributions onto master's record**, never the other way. For D3
   and D4 that specifically means never importing their `DesignCert.lean`.
3. **Each branch keeps its own acceptance.** D3's probe benchmarks, D4's
   round-trip and parser requirements, and FP's conditional support, runtime
   and edge contracts are distinct, and one branch's evidence does not
   discharge another's.
4. **Declared holes stay declared** — `ReifyProof`'s four `sorry`s above all.
5. Native LEC / `single_edge` / frontend contracts, the checker/evaluator
   policy, flat records and the pinned Lean/Mathlib environment are unchanged
   throughout.

## 6. Branch-specific acceptance, from the measured packets

Each branch keeps its own acceptance; one branch's evidence discharges none of
another's. Sources:
`automate_workspace/master_rebase/audits/{d3_acceptance,d4_transport_acceptance,futamura_acceptance}_20261010/requirements.json`.

### 6.1 D3

- Build the definition-only modules **without Mathlib** and the proof modules
  **on the current clock-aware D2 schema**; audit `compileDesign_correct` plus
  the guard and bridge theorem axiom sets, rejecting `sorry` and custom
  assumptions.
- D3's runtime calls use the **old two-argument API**; migrate them to explicit
  `allEdges` compatibility or consistently clock-aware APIs **without metadata
  loss**, preserving arbitrary-edge compiler correctness.
- Three boundary repairs are distributed across `LGraphModel`,
  `ResidualSemantics` and `OpBridge` and must be preserved with their proofs
  and their independent source/residual implementations: **result-width SHL
  saturation, source-width SRA saturation, strict-greater Sext boundary**. The
  permanent boundary matrix includes huge amounts, source/result width
  asymmetry, zero width and strict-equality Sext — **stimulus bounds are not
  shrunk to avoid runtime panics**.
- Simulation "agree" is **sampled evidence**; proof "na" is **unattempted**.
  Both gates and the checker self-test are retained precisely.
- The frozen CVA6-30 names all match the 61-configuration inventory, but that
  is **name coverage only** — not wrapper/source configuration identity, and
  not a replay of D3's procedures.
- D3 scripts/manifests carry historical **private absolute paths**; port to
  project-relative defaults while retaining the logical provenance.

### 6.2 D4

- `parseCert` is **total**, while the header still calls it partial/unverified:
  keep the later total implementation and the round-trip theorem, fix the stale
  documentation.
- **DCERT1 serializes no clocks.** Additive schema defaults do **not** give
  arbitrary-edge metadata fidelity; an explicit format/version disposition is
  required for older DCERT1 data, with **no silent metadata defaulting** for
  edge-aware execution.
- The round-trip theorem promises *every* `DesignCert` but was proved over the
  older schema: the port must **cover every new field rather than narrowing its
  promise unnoticed**, with a full axiom audit.
- The operator decoder uses `Int.toNat` for `Op_Sum` and `Op_MemWriteBE`
  payloads, so **negative payloads normalize to zero**. The malformed-data
  contract is reviewed before any blanket rejection claim: a renderer/parser
  round-trip alone does not establish canonicality on arbitrary input.
- Required evidence also includes **fresh C++ `CertificateIR` vs Lean renderer
  byte/field parity**, malformed/truncated/extra-field/unsupported-version
  controls, whitespace and Unicode in named clocks if the theorem promises
  every `String`, owned publication failure/rollback/pair-coherence tests, and
  D4's own runtime/scale benchmarks.

### 6.3 FP

See §4. In addition: port all 38 module contributions plus the retained
support docs, runner, transport and overlay tools, recording intentional
prototype and deferred status rather than claiming all promoted; run the
retained first-projection fixture, trace, scaling and DCERT runner procedures
on **fresh** transport exports with forced observable output, state checksum
and value comparisons, measuring wall and RSS; validate
clock-independent/quiet/simultaneous/reset edges on the projected step; and
cross-compare checked projected/direct/compiler results **only where all their
admission predicates hold**.

## 7. First migration step, staged

The D3 `Defs` split is **derived, not copied** —
`generated/port_staging/derive_defs_split.py` regenerates it from master's
current clock-aware modules:

| module | definitions moved | theorems retained | scaffold lines kept in both |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `CompileOp` | 1 | 28 | 6 |
| `CompileGraph` | 3 | 6 | 3 |
| `CompileDesign` | 7 | 11 | 3 |

Zero theorems leaked into the definition modules, which is the invariant the
split exists to maintain. The output is **staged, not installed, and not
elaborated** — elaboration writes oleans into the live shared library context
that a running queue depends on.

Copying D3's own `*Defs.lean` would have been the mistake the packet names:
*"`compileFlop` and `compileMemory` lack clock/asyncReset; `ResidualProgram`
construction lacks clocks. This is older schema, not an acceptable replacement
of current post-D2 definitions."*

## 8. Deferred, and explicitly outside any accepted theorem path

`ReifyProof.lean` carries **4 `sorry`s in 1,327 lines**. They travel with the
port as a declared incompleteness: nothing depending on them may be reported as
PROVEN, and no accepted obligation may route through them.
