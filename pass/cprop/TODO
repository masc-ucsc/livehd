--------

If the same pin, drives 2 (or more) cells and those cells also have the same
inputs, the cell can be simplified (redundant)

convert:
  tmp = $x + $y + 2
  tmp2 =0
  if $x + $y + 3 != $inp {
    tmp2 = $x + 1
    tmp2 = tmp2 + 1 + $y
  }
to
  _t = $x + $y
  tmp  = _t + 2
  tmp2 = 0
  if _t + 3 != $inp {
    tmp2 = tmp
  }

Strength Reduction:

convert
 a - b CMP 0
to
 a CMP b

convert
 a + b CMP 0
to
 a CMP -b

convert
 a != 0
to
 or_reduction(a)

convert
 a == -1
to
 and_reduction(a)

convert
 a >> b  ; when b is constant and a.bits known to pick
to
 pick(a,a.__bits-b)

convert
 a <<b  ; when b is constant and a.bits known
to
 join(a,0u(b.__bits))

convert:
  tmp = $x + $y

  if tmp - $z == 0 {
  }
to:
  tmp = $x + $y
  if tmp == $z {
  }

convert
 a + a + c
to
 (a<<1) + c

convert
 a - a + c
to
 c

// Maybe if number of add/sub decreases
convert ?? (may make sense only before FPGA synthesis to do reverse)
 (~a) + 1 + c
to
 -a + c

convert
 a + 0
to
 a

convert
 a * b when power of 2
to
 a << log2(b)

convert
 a * 0
to
 0

convert
 a * 1
to
 a
