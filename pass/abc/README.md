# pass/abc — ABC technology mapping (task 2a-abc)

`lhd pass abc --top <mod> lg:dir --emit-dir lg:netlist` technology-maps a
design to a standard-cell netlist. A prior coloring (`pass color synth`) is
**optional**: it controls how the design is split into per-region modules. With
no coloring (or for any node left at color 0), color 0 is treated as just
another color — the uncolored logic becomes a single `<mod>__c0` region — and
the pass emits one warning that it is partitioning an uncolored design.

It reuses `pass.partition`'s decomposition seam
(`Pass_partition::build_decomposition` + a body-builder hook): one module per
color region, with the **module structure identical to `pass partition`** so each
netlist module LEC-checks against its `partition` twin. The body-builder hook
replaces each region body with an ABC-mapped netlist instead of the original
logic.

## Flow

```
lhd compile ...                         --emit-dir lg:orig
lhd pass color synth --top m lg:orig
lhd pass abc         --top m lg:orig    --emit-dir lg:netlist   # this pass
lhd pass partition   --top m lg:orig    --emit-dir lg:restruct  # the LEC twin
lhd pass liberty gensim file.lib        --emit-dir lg:models    # cell behavior
# LEC: cgen(netlist)+cgen(models) ≡ cgen(restruct), per module
```

## How it maps (`abc_map.cpp`)

Per region (`Region_body` from the partition seam):

1. **to ABC** — bit-blast each comb cell into a 1-bit AIG netlist
   (`ABC_NTK_NETLIST`/`ABC_FUNC_AIG`). Multi-bit module IO becomes per-bit ABC
   PIs/POs (the bit-blast boundary). Supported cells: `and/or/xor/not`,
   `mux/hotmux`, `get_mask/set_mask/sext` (constant mask/position), `sum` +
   `lt/gt/eq` (via the selectable adder library, 2i-abc_arith), `shl` (a
   constant amount becomes pure bit re-wiring, a runtime amount a combinational
   barrel/log shifter; multi-driver one-hot amounts are ORed, matching the LEC),
   and constants. Still `unsupported-cell`: `mult/div/mod` and `sra` (right
   shift).
2. **flow** — `Abc_NtkToLogic` → run `pass.abc.flow` (comb default
   `strash; &get -n; &fraig -x; &put; &get -n; &dch -f; &nf {D}; &put`; seq
   default adds `dretime`) against the `read_lib` Liberty → `Abc_NtkToNetlist`.
3. **from ABC** — each mapped gate becomes a 1-bit blackbox `Sub` named after the
   Liberty cell (`Mio_GateReadName`), with pins from the Mio gate. Multi-bit
   outputs are reassembled with a `Set_mask` concat; inputs are bit-selected with
   `Get_mask`. PI/PO correspondence is matched by **creation order** (ABC
   preserves CI/CO order across the flow).

### Sequential (`seq=true`)

Registers cross into ABC as 1-bit **latches** (`Abc_NtkCreateLatch` + `Bi`/`Bo`)
so ABC can retime/optimize across them, but stay **native `Flop`s** on read-back
(never mapped to library DFFs — the Liberty stays purely combinational). Each
flop's Q-net seeds `bitnet` as a source; its latch D is wired (after the comb
loop) to the folded next-state `reset? rval : (enable? din : Q)`, so the
reconstructed flop is a plain D-flop with only the region clock + power-on
`initial` reattached, and ABC sees the true register function. Latch init comes
from the reset/initial constant. On read-back, latches rebuild into native flops:
a single-root region (one register name) collapses to one named flop, a 1:1
multi-register region rebuilds one flop per register, and a retiming-reshaped
region falls back to `<region>__r<n>` 1-bit flops (all LEC-correct).

### Blackbox boundaries (memories + hierarchical `Sub`)

A region `Memory` or child `Sub` instance is never bit-blasted: its consumed
output pins become fresh ABC PIs (sources), its combinationally-driven inputs
become ABC POs (the cones feeding them), constant inputs are recreated directly,
and the node is rebuilt natively (a `Sub` is re-linked to the partitioned child
def) and reconnected. Boundary PIs/POs are appended after the region ports so the
region read-back stays index-aligned.

ABC's frame is global: one `Abc_Start`/`Abc_Stop` per run, `read_lib` once before
the region loop.

## Options (`--set pass.abc.<flag>=value`)

The option namespace matches the command path (`lhd pass abc`); after the
`pass abc` words the key may be abbreviated (`--set library=…`), see 2h-set_path.

| flag | meaning | default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `library` | Liberty `.lib` for `read_lib` | `$HAGENT_TECH_DIR/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib` |
| `flow` | ABC command string (`{D}`/`{L}` substituted), run verbatim — see below | built-in comb/seq default |
| `seq` | sequential mapping (flops→latches, memories/Subs blackboxed) — a superset that also maps purely combinational regions (no flops ⇒ `dretime` is a no-op), so it is the default | `true` |
| `adder` | comb adder architecture for `sum`/cmp: `rca`/`cska`/`cla` | `rca` |
| `block_size` | CSKA/CLA block width (`0` = auto) | `0` |
| `delay` / `load` | `{D}` / `{L}` substitution | empty |
| `verbose` | per-region gate count | `false` |

### The `flow` string and abc.rc scripts

`flow` is handed verbatim to ABC's `Cmd_CommandExecute`, one `;`-separated
command at a time. Both the classic AIG commands (`balance`, `rewrite`,
`refactor`, `resub`, `strash`, `fraig`, `dch`, `if`, `mfs`) and the GIA `&`-space
commands (`&get`/`&put`, `&dch`, `&fraig`, `&if`, `&nf`, `&deepsyn`, `&resub`,
`&mfs`) work as-is.

LiveHD drives ABC through the library entry (`Abc_Start`), which — unlike the
`abc` binary — never sources `abc.rc`, so its **named synthesis scripts are not
present by default**. The pass therefore installs the standard `abc.rc` scripts
as aliases at startup (`abc_map.cpp`, `kAbcAliases`), so a script name can be
used directly in `flow`:

- short building blocks: `b rw rwz rf rfz rs rsz st f dret`
- AIG opt scripts: `resyn resyn2 resyn2a resyn3 compress compress2 choice choice2`
- resub scripts: `resyn2rs compress2rs src_rw src_rs src_rws`
- GIA scripts: `&dc3 &dc4`

A custom `flow` replaces the whole built-in string, so it must still end with a
technology-mapping step (`&nf {D}`) for the read-back to find cells, e.g.
`--set pass.abc.flow="strash; resyn2; &get -n; &dch -f; &nf {D}; &put"`. Run
`lhd describe pass.abc.flow` for the in-tool cheat-sheet + the upstream `abc.rc`
link. Keep `kAbcAliases` and that help text in sync.

## Source-map carry-through

ABC's `strash`/`dch` destroy per-node provenance, so after mapping each gate is
re-attributed to the **original output cone** it feeds: each output port's driver
`srcid` is re-minted into the body locator (`import_from`), and a backward DFS
from every PO stamps each gate `Sub` in that PO's fanin cone with the output's
srcid (a gate feeding several outputs gets a `combine(...)`, lowest output index
= primary). The output-concat `Set_mask` glue carries the port srcid too. The
emitted netlist therefore points back to the pre-ABC RTL (verify with `cgen --set
cgen.srcmap=1`). Attribution is per-cone, not per-gate — ABC's optimization is
lossy, so exact gate lineage is unrecoverable.

## Status

Combinational mapping (`seq=false`) is complete and LEC-verified
(`//lhd/tests:lhd_abc_test`), with source-map carry-through (above) and the
selectable `sum`/comparator bit-blast (`//lhd/tests:lhd_abc_arith_test`).
Sequential mapping (`seq=true`) — flops↔latches with name preservation +
single-root remap, and memory/`Sub` blackbox boundaries — is complete and
LEC-verified (`//lhd/tests:lhd_abc_seq_test`: flops, memory, and a 3-level
hierarchy) and is the default (`seq=true`). The `shl` bit-blast (constant +
runtime barrel shifter) is LEC-verified by the arith fixture's `shc`/`shv`
outputs. Not yet implemented: `mult/div/mod` + `sra` (right-shift) bit-blast,
and per-region `flow` overrides. See `todo/livehd/2a-abc.html`.
